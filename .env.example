# GenoBear Environment Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and uncomment/modify as needed

# Base folder for all cache/data (default: platformdirs cache)
# GENOBEAR_FOLDER=~/genobear

# Number of parallel download workers (default: CPU count)
# GENOBEAR_DOWNLOAD_WORKERS=8

# Number of workers for general parallel processing (default: CPU count)
# GENOBEAR_WORKERS=4

# Number of workers for parquet operations - conversion AND splitting (default: 4)
# Conservative default to avoid memory overload during parquet I/O operations
GENOBEAR_PARQUET_WORKERS=4

# Download timeout in seconds (default: 3600 = 1 hour)
# GENOBEAR_DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT=3600

# Progress update interval in seconds during downloads (default: 10)
# Lower values = more frequent updates (may cause blinking with many parallel downloads)
# Higher values = less frequent updates (cleaner output)
GENOBEAR_PROGRESS_INTERVAL=10

# Polars configuration for memory efficiency
# Polars verbose mode (default: 0 = disabled for cleaner output)
# Set to 1 to see "rows/second" progress during sink_parquet and collect operations
POLARS_VERBOSE=0

# Polars engine affinity (default: streaming)
# Set to "streaming" to prefer streaming execution for memory efficiency
# Can be set to "default" or "threading" to use standard engine
POLARS_ENGINE_AFFINITY=streaming

# Polars low memory mode (default: 1 = enabled)
# Reduces memory usage during data loading operations (scan_parquet, scan_csv, etc.)
# Set to 0 to disable if you have sufficient memory and want better performance
POLARS_LOW_MEMORY=1

# HuggingFace token for uploads (optional)
# You can use either HF_TOKEN or HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN
# HF_TOKEN=your_token_here
# HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN=your_token_here

# CI mode (automatically set in GitHub Actions)
# GENOBEAR_CI_MODE=true

# Python 3.13+ Free-threaded (non-GIL) settings
# Uncomment to disable the GIL when using a free-threaded Python build (3.13t)
# PYTHON_GIL=0
