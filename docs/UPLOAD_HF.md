# Uploading to Hugging Face

This document describes how to upload genomic data parquet files (Ensembl variations, ClinVar) to Hugging Face Hub datasets.

## Overview

The upload pipeline intelligently uploads parquet files to Hugging Face Hub by:
1. Comparing local file sizes with remote file sizes
2. Only uploading files that differ in size
3. Supporting parallel uploads for efficiency
4. Providing detailed logging and progress tracking
5. Preserving directory structure (e.g., split variants by type: `deletion/`, `SNV/`, `indel/`, etc.)
6. **Automatically generating and uploading dataset cards (README.md)** with dataset description, structure, and usage examples

## Prerequisites

### Authentication

You need a Hugging Face token with write permissions. You can provide it in two ways:

1. **Environment Variable** (recommended):
```bash
export HF_TOKEN="your_token_here"
```

2. **Command-line option**:
```bash
prepare upload-ensembl --token "your_token_here"
```

### Repository Access

You need write access to the target repositories:
- Ensembl: `just-dna-seq/ensembl_variations` 
- ClinVar: `just-dna-seq/clinvar`

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

#### Ensembl Variations

**Basic Usage (Upload from default cache):**
```bash
prepare upload-ensembl
```

> **Note:** When using the default cache without specifying `--source-dir`, the uploader will automatically use the `splitted_variants/` subdirectory if it exists. This preserves the variant type directory structure (SNV/, deletion/, indel/, etc.) in the uploaded dataset. If you want to upload the flat parquet files instead, explicitly specify the source directory: `--source-dir ~/.cache/just-dna-pipelines/ensembl_variations`

**Upload from Custom Directory:**
```bash
prepare upload-ensembl --source-dir /path/to/parquet/files
```

**Combined Download and Upload:**
```bash
# Download, split by variant type, and immediately upload to Hugging Face
prepare ensembl --split --upload

# Download to custom directory and upload to custom repo
prepare ensembl --dest-dir /data/ensembl --split --upload --repo-id username/my-ensembl
```

**Upload to Different Repository:**
```bash
prepare upload-ensembl --repo-id username/my-dataset
```

**With Custom Pattern:**
```bash
# Upload only SNV files
prepare upload-ensembl --pattern "**/SNV/*.parquet"

# Upload only chromosome 21 files
prepare upload-ensembl --pattern "**/*chr21*.parquet"
```

**With Custom Workers:**
```bash
prepare upload-ensembl --workers 8
```

#### ClinVar

**Basic Usage (Upload from default cache):**
```bash
prepare upload-clinvar
```

> **Note:** When using the default cache without specifying `--source-dir`, the uploader will automatically use the `splitted_variants/` subdirectory if it exists. This preserves the variant type directory structure (SNV/, deletion/, indel/, etc.) in the uploaded dataset. If you want to upload the flat parquet files instead, explicitly specify the source directory: `--source-dir ~/.cache/just-dna-pipelines/clinvar`

**Upload from Custom Directory:**
```bash
prepare upload-clinvar --source-dir /path/to/parquet/files
```

**Combined Download and Upload:**
```bash
# Download and immediately upload to Hugging Face
prepare clinvar --split --upload

# Download to custom directory and upload to custom repo
prepare clinvar --dest-dir /data/clinvar --upload --repo-id username/my-clinvar
```

**With Custom Repository:**
```bash
prepare upload-clinvar --repo-id username/my-dataset
```

### Python API

```python
from just_dna_pipelines.preparation.runners import PreparationPipelines
from pathlib import Path

# Ensembl: Basic upload from default cache
results = PreparationPipelines.upload_ensembl_to_hf()

# Ensembl: Upload from custom directory
results = PreparationPipelines.upload_ensembl_to_hf(
    source_dir=Path("/path/to/parquet/files"),
    repo_id="just-dna-seq/ensembl_variations",
    token="your_token_here",
    workers=8
)

# ClinVar: Basic upload from default cache
results = PreparationPipelines.upload_clinvar_to_hf()

# ClinVar: Upload from custom directory
results = PreparationPipelines.upload_clinvar_to_hf(
    source_dir=Path("/path/to/clinvar"),
    repo_id="just-dna-seq/clinvar",
    token="your_token_here",
    workers=4
)

# Check results
uploaded_files = results.uploaded_files
for file_info in uploaded_files:
    print(f"{file_info.file}: uploaded={file_info.uploaded}, reason={file_info.reason}")
```

### Low-Level API

```python
from just_dna_pipelines.pipelines.huggingface_uploader import upload_parquet_to_hf
from pathlib import Path

# Collect your parquet files
parquet_files = list(Path("/path/to/data").glob("*.parquet"))

# Upload with size comparison
results = upload_parquet_to_hf(
    parquet_files=parquet_files,
    repo_id="just-dna-seq/ensembl_variations",
    token="your_token_here",
    path_prefix="data",
    parallel=True,
    workers=4
)
```

## Command-line Options

### Upload Commands (`upload-ensembl`, `upload-clinvar`)

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `--source-dir` | Default cache | Source directory containing parquet files |
| `--repo-id` | `just-dna-seq/ensembl_variations` or `just-dna-seq/clinvar` | Hugging Face repository ID |
| `--token` | `$HF_TOKEN` | Hugging Face API token |
| `--pattern` | `**/*.parquet` | Glob pattern for finding files |
| `--path-prefix` | `data` | Prefix for paths in the repository |
| `--workers` | Auto (CPU count) | Number of parallel upload workers |
| `--log/--no-log` | `--log` | Enable detailed logging |

### Download with Upload (`clinvar`)

Additional options for `prepare clinvar` command:

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `--upload/--no-upload` | `--no-upload` | Upload parquet files after download |
| `--repo-id` | `just-dna-seq/clinvar` | Hugging Face repository ID for upload |
| `--token` | `$HF_TOKEN` | Hugging Face API token |

## Output

The command provides:

1. **Progress Display**: Real-time upload status with rich formatting
2. **Summary Statistics**:
   - Total files processed
   - Files uploaded (new or size changed)
   - Files skipped (size match)
3. **Detailed Logs**: JSON and text logs in the `logs/` directory

## How It Works

### Directory Structure Preservation

When uploading from the default cache location (no `--source-dir` specified), the uploader follows this logic:

1. **Check for Split Variants**: First checks if a `splitted_variants/` subdirectory exists in the cache
2. **Preserve Structure**: If it exists, uses that directory and preserves the variant type subdirectory structure:
   ```
   data/
   ├── SNV/
   │   ├── homo_sapiens-chr1.parquet
   │   ├── homo_sapiens-chr2.parquet
   │   └── ...
   ├── deletion/
   │   ├── homo_sapiens-chr1.parquet
   │   └── ...
   ├── indel/
   │   └── ...
   ├── insertion/
   │   └── ...
   └── substitution/
       └── ...
   ```
3. **Fallback to Flat Structure**: If `splitted_variants/` doesn't exist, uses the main cache directory with flat structure:
   ```
   data/
   ├── homo_sapiens-chr1.parquet
   ├── homo_sapiens-chr2.parquet
   └── ...
   ```

This ensures that if you ran download/split operations (e.g., `prepare ensembl --split`), the upload will automatically preserve that organization.

### Dataset Card Generation

The upload pipeline **automatically generates and uploads a README.md dataset card** for your HuggingFace dataset. The dataset card includes:

- **Description**: What the dataset contains and why Parquet format is used
- **Structure**: Directory organization and variant types
- **Usage Examples**: Code snippets for Polars, DuckDB, and just-dna-pipelines
- **Schema**: Column descriptions
- **Citations**: How to cite the dataset and original data sources
- **Metadata**: Dataset tags, license, and size categories for proper HuggingFace discovery

The dataset card is tailored for each dataset type:
- **Ensembl**: Focuses on variant annotations and genomic variations
- **ClinVar**: Emphasizes clinical significance and pathogenicity data

#### Template-Based Customization

Dataset cards are generated from **template files** in the `dataset_cards/` directory:
- `ensembl_card_template.md` - For Ensembl variations
- `clinvar_card_template.md` - For ClinVar

You can **customize these templates** to modify the dataset description, add custom sections, or change the formatting. The templates support variables like:
- `{{num_files}}` - Total number of files
- `{{total_size_gb}}` - Dataset size
- `{{update_date}}` - Current date
- `{{variant_types_section}}` - Auto-generated variant types

See `dataset_cards/README.md` for full documentation on template customization.

The card is uploaded in the same commit as the data files, ensuring your dataset is properly documented and discoverable on HuggingFace Hub.

### Size Comparison Logic

For each file:
1. Calculate local file size
2. Query remote file size from Hugging Face Hub
3. Compare sizes:
   - **Match**: Skip upload (file already up to date)
   - **Differ**: Upload file with commit message
   - **New**: Upload file (file doesn't exist remotely)

### Upload Strategy

- Files are uploaded in parallel using multiple workers
- Each file is uploaded independently
- Failures on individual files don't stop the entire process
- Detailed logging tracks success and failures

## Integration with Download Pipeline

Complete workflow examples:

### Ensembl (Two-Step)
```bash
# 1. Download and process Ensembl data
prepare ensembl --split --pattern "chr(21|22)"

# 2. Upload to Hugging Face
prepare upload-ensembl

# 3. Check logs
cat logs/upload_ensembl.log
```

### ClinVar (One-Step)
```bash
# Download, process, and upload in one command
prepare clinvar --split --upload

# Check logs
cat logs/prepare_clinvar.log
cat logs/upload_clinvar.log
```

### ClinVar (Two-Step)
```bash
# 1. Download and process ClinVar data
prepare clinvar --split

# 2. Upload to Hugging Face separately
prepare upload-clinvar

# Check logs
cat logs/upload_clinvar.log
```

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Errors

If you get authentication errors:
```bash
# Login to Hugging Face CLI
huggingface-cli login

# Or set token explicitly
export HF_TOKEN="your_token_here"
```

### Permission Errors

Ensure you have write access to the repository. For `just-dna-seq/ensembl_variations`, you need to be a collaborator.

### Network Errors

The pipeline will log errors but continue with other files. Check `logs/upload_ensembl_hf.log` for details.

### Large Files

For very large files, consider:
- Increasing the timeout (if added as option)
- Using fewer workers to reduce memory pressure
- Uploading in batches with custom patterns

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `HF_TOKEN` | Hugging Face API token |
| `JUST_DNA_PIPELINES_WORKERS` | Default number of workers |
| `JUST_DNA_PIPELINES_FOLDER` | Base folder for Just DNA Pipelines data |

## Notes

- The upload pipeline uses the `huggingface_hub` library
- File comparison is based on size only (not content hash)
- Commit messages are automatically generated
- All uploads are tracked in eliot logs for full traceability
